        "histori1": "It all started with a personal reflection: how could I convey the excitement I felt when driving for the first time, and the contrast with the years that followed, where an oppressive work environment and a car that felt too 'normal' made me lose that spark? I wanted to create something that spoke about authenticity — about not letting the system dim your light — while at the same time connecting with my passion for JDM culture, streetwear, and automotive tuning.",
        "histori2": "From that restlessness, STRV (Strive) was born — an initial concept meant to embody the idea of fighting for your dreams. However, the project evolved into HASHIRI CO., a stronger name that directly connects with movement and speed: in Japanese, 'Hashiri' means 'to run' or 'race'. With no budget to hire a designer, I decided to build the brand’s identity using my own resources: typographic design, digital collage, and accessible tools like Figma and Canva.",
